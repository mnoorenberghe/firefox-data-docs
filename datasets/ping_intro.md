We receive data from our users via **pings**.
There are several types of pings,
each containing different measurements and sent for different purposes.
To review a complete list of ping types and their schemata, see 
[this section of the Mozilla Source Tree Docs](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/data/index.html).

#### Background and Caveats

The large majority of analyses can be completed using only the
[main ping](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/data/main-ping.html).
This ping includes histograms, scalars, and other performance and diagnostic data.

Few analyses actually rely directly on the raw ping data.
Instead, we provide **derived datasets** which are processed versions of these data,
made to be:
* Easier and faster to query
* Organized to make the data easier to analyze
* Cleaned of erroneous or misleading data

Before analyzing raw ping data,
**check to make sure there isn't already a derived dataset** made for your purpose.
If you do need to work with raw ping data, be aware that loading the data can take a while.
Try to limit the size of your data by controlling the date range, etc.

#### Accessing the Data

You can access raw ping data from an 
[ATMO cluster](https://analysis.telemetry.mozilla.org/) using the 
[Dataset API](https://python-moztelemetry.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#module-moztelemetry.dataset).
Raw ping data are not available in [re:dash](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/).
